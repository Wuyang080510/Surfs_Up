# Surfs_Up
Analyzing weather data with Python, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy. Building a webpage to present the analysis with Flask.

## Purpose 
- Use SQLite, a faster and small desktop database, to condect data analysis
- Connect Python and SQLite with SQLAlchemy 
- Use statistics like mean, percentile, min, and max to analyze data
### Overview
In this project, an investor asked me to condect a weather analysis before he opens a Surf n' Ice Cream Shop on Oahu, Hawaii. His main concern is that the pricipatition will limit the days for surf and the days the shop can open for business through out the year. To check if this is a feasible idea, I conducted a weather analysis with the hawaii.sqlite database. I connected the SQLite with Python with the SQLAlchemy library, conducted queries in Python, and created statistic summary table for temperatures and pricipitation in June and December. 

## Results 
Two statistics summary table were returned for temperature distributation in June and December.

img_December_Temp

- June and December Temps have similiar distribution a symmetrical distribution

- June and December Temps run stable 

- pricipitation levels in June and December are low
    Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
    Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
    Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
